JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS to enhance user experience, enabling functionalities like form validations, animations, and handling user events such as clicks and keyboard inputs. Over the years, it has evolved significantly and now supports modern web development frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js. These advancements make JavaScript a crucial tool for front-end development, as well as for some back-end applications through environments like Node.js.</p>
